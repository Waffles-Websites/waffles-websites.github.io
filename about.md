**Cedar Grove Christian** is a local country church with a simple heartbeat: *love God, love people, share the Gospel.*
We’re not fancy or corporate. We’re family—gathering to worship Jesus, grow in His Word, and serve our neighbors.

### What we value
- **Christ‑centered worship:** Songs and teaching that honor Jesus and cling to Scripture.
- **Hospitality:** We welcome everyone because Christ welcomed us.
- **Discipleship:** We grow better together—across generations.
- **Service:** Faith that rolls up its sleeves and helps.

If you’re looking for a place to belong, we saved you a seat.
