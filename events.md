We keep things simple but meaningful. Here are some ideas to get us started. Replace these with real dates as you’d like.

- **Coffee & Conversation** — First Sunday each month after service
- **Mid‑Week Prayer** — Wednesdays at { "{ site.service_times.wednesday_bible_study }" }
- **Family Sunday** — Fifth Sundays: kids and youth serve in worship

<!--*Tip:* You can edit this page in `events.md`. Add new items as `- **Event Title** — Date/Time`.-->
